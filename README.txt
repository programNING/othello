**README FOR OTHELLO GAME**
TEAM: Sandra Ning 

IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
	- added minimax!
	- added alpha-beta pruning to minimax!
	- added a weight table for the othello board 

	- tried adding improvements to heuristics based on a weight table and
	"coin parity"/"mobility parity" according to a paper listed below, but the
	heuristics were actually terrible, probably because i picked and chose from
	the full heuristics described in the paper.

My improvements are pretty alright; they just do the simple things requested
of me. I think the weight table helps the Othello AI focus on gathering its pieces
close together, but also moving toward and taking edges.
